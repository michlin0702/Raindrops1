*RAINDROPS*

*GAME ALGORITHM*

- Create a score tracking variable

- Create a raindrop array

	- Set number of desired raindrops

- Create a catcher to "catch" falling raindrops

	- Set catcher x coordinate to follow mouse

- Create a raindrop
	
	- Each raindrop should have a location, velocity, and possibly an acceleration, if wanted
		
		- Location: at top of screen
		
		- Velocity: random value between _ and _ 

- One raindrop will fall (0.move)

	- After raindrop falls, after set time interval, next raindrop will fall

- Check to see if raindrop touches catcher (function)

- OBJECTIVE: "Catch" falling raindrops by moving catcher
		
		- Player's score will increase

		- Raindrop will disappear


*IMPORTANT QUESTIONS/PROBLEMS*

- I cannot find a way to make the umbrellas disappear one at a time without making the code more complicated than necessary... 

  As one raindrop falls off the screen, one umbrella should disappear to indicate the amount of lives the player has left



*WHAT TO ADD TO GAME*

- Will have levels increasing with difficulty

- Will have set amount of lives

- Must catch certain amount of raindrops in certain amount of time

- If complete level within time, will receive bonus

	- Storm cloud appears and more raindrops appear, allowing player chance to gain more points

- If running out of time to complete level, the sun will start to appear to "dry" the raindrops, decreasing player chances to complete level

- If failed at completing level within time, will lose life

- If lost all lives, GAME OVER.
